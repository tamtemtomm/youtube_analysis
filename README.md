# youtube_analysis
Hello guys, It's my first time to really dig into EDA. I am currently interested on media social dataset.
So, i look out for nice concise well structured dataset out there. Because my skill on web scraping is still terrible. 
And finally i got one on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rsrishav/youtube-trending-video-dataset. 
i also did a special analysis for indonesia, i found the dataset on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syahrulhamdani/indonesias-trending-youtube-video-statistics
I am interested to see what happen on recent years. Certainly a lot of things happened. I wanna see what people reaction to it. 

I did an in depth analysis on US dataset. I also include some base analysis if you wanna deep dive to another country dataset on the link
Tell me if you need something, peace.
